# Team Data Science Process from Microsoft

This repository contains the **Team Data Science Process (TDSP) from Microsoft**. 
TDSP is an agile, iterative, data science methodology to improve collaboration and team learning. It is supported through a lifecycle definition, standard project structure, artifact templates, and tools for productive data science. 

Here we provide a version of TDSP for instantiation from **Vienna**.

## Information about TDSP in Vienna
When you instantiate TDSP from Vienna, you get the TDSP-recommended standardized directory structure, and document templates for project execution and delivery.

## Release Notes

This is an **early preview (Sept 2016)** release of TDSP. We are continuously improving TDSP based on our further accumulated experience, and customer feedback. Stay tuned for future releases.
