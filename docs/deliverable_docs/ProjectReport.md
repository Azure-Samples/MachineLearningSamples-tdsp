# Data Science Project Report: (Insert Customer/Client & Use Case Title)

[comment]: # (This document is intended to capture the use case summary for this engagement. An executive summary should contain a brief overview of the project, but not every detail. Only the current summary should be captured here and this should be edited over time to reflect the latest details.)

[comment]: # (Some ideas of what to include in the executive summary are detailed below. Please edit and capture the relevant information within each section)

[comment]: # (To capture more detail in the scoping phase, the optional template Scoping.md may be utilized. If more detail around the data, use case, architecture, or other aspects needs to be captured, additional markdown files can be referenced and placed into the Docs folder)
## 1. Business Understanding
### Customer & Business Problem
 *  Who is the client, what is their business domain?
 * 	What is the business problem (in business terms) that the customer is looking to solve?

### Scope

 * How is it going to be consumed by the customer and how will the customer use the model results to make decisions?
 * What are the deliverables?

## Plan
Phases (milestones), timeline, short description of what we'll do in each phase.
