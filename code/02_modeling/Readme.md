# Code/02_Modeling

For source code files associated with the predictive models. Although we haven't done it her in this template, if it makes sense to organize your project's source code further according to stages of the Modeling phase, you should create futher sub-folders for your code:

**Code\Modeling\01_FeatureEngineering**

**Code\Modeling\02_ModelCreation**

**Code\Modeling\03_ModelEvaluation**


For an example of what a modeling report could include, see this in TDSP public GitHub repo [(link)](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-ProjectTemplate/blob/master/Docs/Model/FinalReport.md). You can also include the modeling report (information) in the ProjectReport file in the top level folder for your porject.
